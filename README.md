## Project Goals

The overall project goal is to ensure that consumers can easily purchase printed art direct from the artists themselves, cutting out the need for artists to involve third parties who would charge commission. The art needs to be displayed in a simple manner so as not to distract the customer when thinking of making a purchase.

* As an artist I want to be able to create new income streams by displaying my work alongside other artists
